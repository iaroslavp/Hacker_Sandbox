How to use the Hacker Sandbox programming language

In Hacker Sandbox each line of code is seperated by **_semicolons_**.

Note: White italic scentences/symbols represent highlights.

set "testVar" = "Hello, World!"**_;_**

console log testVar**_;_**

Each line of code is a bunch command seperateds by **_spaces_**.

There's the main command in front, one to few sub commands and a couple input commands.

console_log_"test";
