How to use the Hacker Sandbox programming language

In Hacker Sandbox each line of code is seperated by **semicolons**.

Note: White italic scentences/symbols represent highlights.

set "testVar" = "Hello, World!" **;**

console log testVar **;**

Each line of code is a bunch command seperateds by **spaces**.

There's the main command in front, one to few sub commands and a couple input commands.

console_log_"test" ;
